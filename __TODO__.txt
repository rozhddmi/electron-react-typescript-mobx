[ ] Figure out how to get Live Reload of main process via https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-compile
[ ] Configure installers via https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-builder
[ ] Configure auto-updater https://www.electron.build/auto-update

[ ] update demo page in repo
[ ] publish repo
[ ] publish demo html


[ ] Finish README
    [ ] Explain directory structure
        [ ] two separate html's, one for site one for electron, very similar
        [ ] shared folder is for shared between renderer and site (don't currently share renderer&main or shared&main)
    
    [ ] scripts
        [ ] pack-dev/pack-prod 
            [ ] use typescript compiler to generate *.js files that can be loaded by electron into main process
            [ ] call webpack twice to build as both website and electron app 
        [ ] build 
            [ ] is called by vs code debugger so keep it simple and fast = no installers (use dev and prod to do real builds that generate installers since installers are slow to compress)
        [ ] NODE_ENV development means run in a local server environment, production means real electron build
